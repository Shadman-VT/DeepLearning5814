Develop a series of deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU) to capture both short-term and long-term evolution dynamics of extreme TWL along the U.S. coastline.
Develop a stacked Meta-Model to improve the accuracy of TWL predictions under extreme conditions by leveraging multiple deep-learning models to capture complex dependencies.
Investigate the transferability of the developed model to predict extreme TWL farther along the USA coastline to Clearwater Beach, Florida (NOAA Station id: 8726724), to assess its generalization capability under different geographic and tidal states.
